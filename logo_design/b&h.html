            <p class="square-img-copy  copy">Sandi Harris and the late Steve Barber's lute business features several original logos they hand-designed, which are branded onto their stunning and unique instruments â€” lutes and guitars.</p>

            <p class="square-img-copy  copy">Sandi needed a digital design that not only combined both logos, but also carried a commemorative aspect, as Steve had sadly passed away.</p>

            <p class="square-img-copy  copy"> The initial designs combined the flying pegasus, the unicorn and the hand-crafted urn created by Sandi for Steve's ashes. 
            From there, Sandi expressed she wanted a more intricate design which still had both element clearly recognisable, including more of the rosette from the handmade wooden urn, which led to this final.
            I was very honoured to have the chance to work on this, and to be able to give Sandi an all encompassing symbol of their joint legacy.

        <h3>DESIGN PROCESS</h3>
        <p>
            To give you an idea of process, my brief was to combine the two symbols into one,
            so I initially thought the best way to do this was to create a hybrid unicorn pegasus
            which you can see below. I also wanted it to feel like a sigil you could
            put on a flag, a ring, or indeed, a lute.</p>
        <p>However in this case Sandi was surprised by my line of thinking and noted
            she wanted to keep both figures intact, so combined in another way. My first attempt
            at this alteration became the final.
