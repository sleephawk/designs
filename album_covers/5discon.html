                My first single, <em>Disconnected</em>, as sole producer on Sleephawk, written in a time of mental health struggle, but also 
                creative growth, with this being the year I learned how to design with <em>Blender 3D</em>.
                <br>
                <br>
                This shot is taken from the music video, which explores a world in which people are rebuilt from 
                a state of physical fragmentation. The video took about a year to learn and create, which was 
                an incredible learning experience, whilst also a stark light on how much work being 
                a musician/ songwriter / producer / designer / animator is.
