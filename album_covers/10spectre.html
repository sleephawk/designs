                Snoozecrow is a character long overdue for his debut. Conceptually, he's an ambient musician haunted by a friendly ghost, and 
                his story is one of managing anxiety through self-soothing and music.

                This piece started as an inverted pencil sketch and was the origin of the Snoozecrow moniker — 
                a project that never fully came to life. You can hear the demos on the left.
