                This EP was written around the complexity of dating with anxiety or an anxious disposition, 
                exploring self-sabotage, dating apps and overthinking. The 4 track EP's cover was made 
                at the same time as <em>Glass</em>, creating two figures with complex, unreadable
                identities represented by fragments in place of faces. The song <em>Tabby, (All My Friends Were Right)</em> 
                marked Sleephawk's first radio play on BBC Radio 1 Intro and BBC Radio 6, featuring long time 
                collaborator Aymee Weir.

                Each piece in this series was created using my unique collage method and style, aiming
                at creating surreal fragemented spaces that reflect the overlaying of feelings and 
                images that we are bombared with by technology.
