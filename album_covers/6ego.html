                    My first album <em>Ego Will Be the Death of You 2020</em> written in a time of mental health struggle, but also 
                    creative growth, with this being the year I learned how to design with <em>Blender 3D</em>. The whole album 
                    was finished during 2020 Covid as the strange side-effect of the time was having a lot of time 
                    to be creative, which led me to finish off all the songs that peppered the previous year.
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    This design is actually taken from a ureleased music video, which matched the <em>Disconnected</em> aesthetic
                    but extended them into a realm of video game horror characters and symbols. I decided it was too ambitious as a full video, but the 
                    scenes made it into the Spotify canvases for each song, giving an extra dimension to the 
                    tone and world of the album.
