                For a single inspired by the fact that throughout life
                many people have pointed out my likeness to George Harrison â€” the song explores 
                identity, especially the unique feeling of being a musician in this age: living
                in the shadow of greater musicians, and how to enjoy being who we are without
                comparing (too much).

                I completed it whilst in Bangkok using pen and cheap watercolours I found 
                at a hardware shop, reflecting on
                the symbols that make me who I am and including as many as possible in the colorful
                plume coming out of my head.
