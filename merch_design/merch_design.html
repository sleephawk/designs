                    Aymee Weir wanted a limited edition design for a T-Shirt. 
                    The brief was simple and cool, a 'print' style image in the centre, with lyrics either side, a serif font mixed with san serif for the text, and an arrangement of lyrics on the back. 
                    Fortunately I hit the nail on the head in the first design, & Aymee was very happy!
                    We managed to go start to finish in the space of days, which is always an exciting moment.
