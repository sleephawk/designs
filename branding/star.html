            <p class="square-img-copy copy">This piece was created as a gift for a friend who supported me at my time 
                in Bukit Lawang, Indonesia. Whilst volunteering there, I lived in the outhouses
                they had built with their husband and often spent days and afternoons chatting 
                about everything with them, sharing stories and food together. I am forever 
                grateful to them both. The style is greatly inspired a few things - the clearest being art nouveau, but also
                how art nouveau has grown into card art such as tarot and, one of my hobbies,
                Magic the Gathering. </p>
                <p class="square-img-copy copy">I want to explore this style much more and hope to one day make either tarot or 
                MTG art of the style.
