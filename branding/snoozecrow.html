            <p class="square-img-copy copy">Snoozecrow is a character that is long overdue to have his
                debut. In concept, he's an ambient musician with a friendly ghost who haunts him, and 
                his story is one of dealing with anxiety through self soothing and music.

                This piece is created on Illustrator and inspired by my deep love for modern cartoons
                like Bojack Horseman and Over the Garden Wall.
