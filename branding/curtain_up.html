                        In 2024 I volunteered with Curtain Up Drama and Magic in Bangkok as they went through a rebrand. 
                        Using their new logo and brand assets, I created a wide range of print materials, social media posts, and adverts.

                        I used Canva and occasionally Adobe Rush to quickly produce branded reels and ads. Deadlines were tight, so I relied on my artistic instincts to deliver bold, timely content.
                        <br><br>
                        Here are a few of my favourites above.

                With references, briefs, and direction, I approached the brand from two angles, for two demographic groups.
            </p>
            <p>
                The first appeals to children and parents through bold colour, expressive graphics, and theatrical visuals.
            </p>
            <p>
                The second appeals to Bangkokâ€™s artistic and social scenes with a more minimal style, inviting audiences to bring their own ideas into the space. This was a new direction as Curtain Up began renting studios for events and performances.
            </p>
            <p>
                This required two distinct sets of printed materials, as shown by these trifold designs.
